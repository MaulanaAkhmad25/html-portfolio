    <h3>Avatar</h3>
    <p>
      Not only was Avatar technologically advanced, but the content of the film
      also covered a variety of relevant topics. From race relations and a call
      for revolution to the destruction of natural habitats for the sake of
      greed, Avatar brings forward the true nature of how humans have chosen to
      treat the land.

    <h3>One Piece</h3>
    <p>
      One Piece has become incredibly well-known over time, both in Japan and
      outside. The manga is an all-time best-selling manga series with over 500
      million copies sold globally.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the factors contributing to One Piece's immense popularity is its
      fantastic world-building. Oda has crafted a wide, deep, and diverse
      universe that is populated by intriguing characters, interesting places,
      and complex political systems. One Piece's world is made up of numerous
      oceans and islands, each home to a unique population of people, animals,
      and customs.

    <p>
      The use of Sea Prism Stone and the production of Devil Fruits are just two
      examples of the unusual technology that exists on the planet. Because of
      the extensive history and mythology that Oda has developed, the show's
      universe feels authentic and real.

      In conclusion, One Piece is a fantastic anime series that has held
      viewers' attention for more than 20 years. It stands out among top anime
      series of all time, thanks to its unique world-building, powerful
